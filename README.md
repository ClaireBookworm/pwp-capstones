# Tome Rater

This is the project for the capstones project.

I wrote all the classes and objects for the basic populate.py, which I copied in for my use.
I added a user interface that takes input.

There are a few questions I didn't understand. I think I added them in the code. The most fragile function in my code is the add_book_to_user function in TomeRater class. I really don't understand why user and book need to be lowercase and how the function really works.

Thanks!
